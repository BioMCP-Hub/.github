# BioMCP-Hub.org

Welcome to **[BioMCP-Hub.org](BioMCP-Hub.org)**, an innovative service hub for life sciences that redefines how research is conducted. We are building the **next-generation MCP (Model Context Protocol)**, designed specifically for data search, literature mining, model integration, and bioinformatics analysis in life sciences. Our goal is to make scientific discovery smarter, faster, and more collaborative.
